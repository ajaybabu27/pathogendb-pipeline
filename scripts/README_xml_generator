xml_generator.py takes a project file project.xml and an isolates file isolates.txt and outputs an XML file for submission to the SRA at NCBI. The format for 
project.xml is:
	    <BioProject>
	    Release date
	    Name of BioProject
	    Title of BioProject
	    Medical Relevance
	    Type(mono or multi-isolate)
	    Organism Name
	    </BioProject>

The isolates.txt file is in the form
            CD0001
	    CD0003
	    etc.

The program is then invoked as follows:
    python xml_generator.py project.xml isolates.txt > output.xml
